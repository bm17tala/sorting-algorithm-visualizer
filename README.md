# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Academic Showcase Project Spring 2024 - CSIS 385

Names: Brenden Talasco, Sean O'Malley

This project showcases the efficiency of several different sorting algorithms using a graphical representation of data from [Dr. Teresco's METAL project](https://courses.teresco.org/metal/). The user may also run tests on the METAL
data to determine the speed of each algorithm on their machine.

To run, simply run the main.py source file. Please note that this project requires that the [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) and [pysine](https://github.com/lneuhaus/pysine) libraries are installed with pip to run.
